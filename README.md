# Assignment2: Submit cacheMatrix.R function

### This is the submission of R Programming assignment2. The function follows the following step:

a. `makeCacheMatrix`: This function creates a special "matrix" object
    that can cache its inverse.
    
1.  set the value of the matrix
2.  get the value of the matrix

b. `cacheSolve`: This function computes the inverse of the special
    "matrix" returned by `makeCacheMatrix` above. If the inverse has
    already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then
    `cacheSolve` should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
    
3.  set the inverse value of the matrix
4.  get the inverse value of the matrix
